  If you were using it with multiple codes such as `[coupon_is_not_valid code="a,b"]...[/coupon_is_not_valid]` then you might
  need to reverse the logic applied for consistent results: `[coupon_is_not_valid op="or" code="a,b"]...[/coupon_is_not_valid]`.
  Similarly, if you were using `op="or"` you would now use `op="and"` with this shortcode.
